### Abstract

This data set is an open dataset from Kaggle, Lending Club Loan Data. https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data

The first map (Map 1) introduces the loan information in 2018 and 2019, including number of loans, issued loan amounts, average income on each state etc. On the right bottom side of the page, there is a gauge for the ratio of issued loan amount on 2019 and 2018. This gauge presents the percentage of target achieved on 2019.

The second map (Map 2) shows the bad loans which may be potentially default or default already. The loans status includes "Charge Off", "In Grace Period", "Late Payments" and "Default". The information in map includes number of bad loans, bad loan amounts, average debt-to-income ratio and average annual income etc. 

It is noted that there are the hover information shown when the mouse point to the states in map. The colors in gradient present the degree of expected revenue calculated by total interests (Map 1) and the interest lost in bad loans (Map 2). 

The table at the right side is a brief introduction in numbers between 2018 and 2019. You can drag the columns left or right for your convenience.

The bar chart shows the average annual income against each home ownership.

On this side bar, you can choose the region(s) you want to know.

Please note that this plot does not present bad loan data only.

Assoication {data-icon="fas fa-chart-pie"}
=======================================================================

Column {.sidebar}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This moasic plot indicates the association between credit grades and class of income.

For each loan purpose selection, the plot would show the specific findings on selected loan purpose. 

Signs at the right reveal the Pearson residuals. Blue means positively assoicated; Red means negatively associated.

For example, in "Business" loan purpose category, the moasic plot shows Grade A is negatively associated with Low Income Category and positively associated with High and Medium. The color degree refers to the Pearson Residuals.


```{r}
#create dataset only included three columns
vcd_loan <- loan_raw[,c("grade", "title", "income_cat")]

title_type<- c("Business", "Car financing", "Credit card refinancing", "Debt consolidation", 
               "Green loan", "Home buying", "Home improvement", "Major purchase", "Medical expenses",
               "Moving and relocation", "Other")
#create a select input
selectInput("title","Loan Purpose:", choices = title_type, selected = "Business")

```




Column

### Mosaic Plot
